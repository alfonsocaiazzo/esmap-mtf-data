# Energy Access Data at the Household Level (ESMAP Sector - The World Bank)

## Get Started
This repository is related to building an analysis pipeline for publicly available data from The World Bank.

The data have been collected in the context of the [Multi-Tier Framework](https://mtfenergyaccess.esmap.org/) for measuring energy access at the household level.
In this framework, **access to energy** is measured taking into account different attributes (e.g., *Is energy available throughout the day/the year?*, *Is
the energy safe and healthy?*,  *Is it affordable?*)

Currently, there are data available for several countries:
- [Rwanda](https://mtfenergyaccess.esmap.org/country/rwanda)
- Ethiopia
- Myanmar
- Nepal
- Cambodia
- Sao Tom√©
- Zambia

The data comprises two main chapters: 
- **Access to Electricity**: type of energy power sources used (grid, solar, etc.), costs, type of connection, type of appliances, etc.
- **Access to modern Cooking solutions**: type of stoves and cooking fuels used for preparing meals, time needed to collect and prepare fuel, costs, safety, etc.
